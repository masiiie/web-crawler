# Crawler


Python implementation of a web crawler that, from a set of seed urls, retrieves the most similar 10 000 pages.



The crawler implemented is *specific-topic*, since it will collect the 1000 pages most similar to a default one, and all are expected to address the same topic or well-related topics. In this case, the url chosen is [Pintura](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintura).
